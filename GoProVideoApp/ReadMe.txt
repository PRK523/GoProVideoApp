 1) My initial idea for this application was to build a simple video app that has a UISlider to track the time of the video that's playing.
 2) Also, i thought about using local video from our Photo gallery but i guess that was not a requirement.
 3) I have implemented the initial idea without using a scrubber for seeking the video frames, if needed i can share the implementation.
 4) In this implementation version i have used AVFoundation to play the local video shared in the coding project folder.
 5) To implement the video scrubber and seek through the frames of the video i have embedded ABVideoRangeSlider
 framework using pods.
 6) The Play and Pause buttons are used to not just start and pause the video but also to pause the progress indicator when you are seeking through the video.
 7) I have shown the current Timestamp of the video when the indicator stops or is seeking through the video.
 8) Hopefully, this implementation covers up all the requirements.
 9) This was really good learning experience loved this challenge :)
